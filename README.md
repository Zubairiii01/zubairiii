### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an IT Student with a strong foundation in **Network Engineering** and **System Administration**, currently expanding my focus into **Cybersecurity Operations (SOC)**.

I bridge the gap between building infrastructure and securing it. My current main focus is implementing and managing **SIEM solutions** (specifically **Wazuh**) to monitor, detect, and respond to threats in real-time.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a **Mini-SOC Lab using Wazuh & Shuffle**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Threat Hunting, Log Analysis, and Incident Response**.
- 🛡️ My goal is to secure enterprise networks through proactive monitoring and robust architecture.
